1. Sliding Window - to perform a required operation on specific window size of a given array or linked list

    * The problem input is linear data structure such as linked list, array, or string.
    * asked to find the longest/shortest substring, subarray, or a desired value

2. Two Pointers or iterators - pattern where two pointers iterate through a data structure in tandem until
    one or both of the pointers hit a certain condition

    * it will feature problems where you deal with sorted arrays (or linked lists)
    * the set of elements in the array is a pair, a triplet, or even subarray

3. Fast and Slow pointers - also know as Hare and Tortoise algo, uses two pointers which move through the array
    (or a sequence/linked list) at different speeds.

    * the problem will deal with a loop in a linked list or array
    * when you need to know the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linkedlist.

4. Merge Intervals - technique to deal with overlapping intervals, or merge intervals if they overlap

    * if you're asked to produce a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
    * if you hear the term "overlapping intervals"

5. Cyclic sort - deal with problems involving arrays containing numbbers in a given range. Iterates
    over the array one number at a time, and if the current number you are iterating is not at the correct index,
    you swap it with the number at the correct index

    * they will be problems involving a sorted array with numbers in a given range
    * if the problem asks you to find the missing/duplicates/smallest number in a sorted/rotated array
